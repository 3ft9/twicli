TwiCLI
======

A playground for me to play with creating an IRC-style CLI client for Twitter.

Usage
-----

The first time you run twicli.py it will ask for the key and secret for your
app (yes, you'll need to set up an app at https://dev.twitter.com/apps), and
then gives you a Twitter URL to visit at which you can log in. Once logged in
Twitter will display a PIN number. Copy/paste or type that in to the TwiCLI
prompt and the screen should clear other than a message in the bottom-left
saying you're connected. Any tweets that would be displayed on your home
timeline will now be displayed.

What's next?
------------

See RAMBLINGS.md for details.

Why?
----

As mentioned above this is primarily just a playground where I can explore
several ideas I have for a text-based Twitter client. As a developer I spend
most of my time with my fingers on a keyboard, so the idea of a Twitter client
that can be used in that same way really appeals.

Wanna help?

If you want to contribute to my playground please feel free. You'll probably
want to make sure you read RAMBLINGS.md to get an idea of where I'm going.
